# This workflow runs a handful of integrity checks.

# when:
#   - a pull request is opened against main
#   - commits are pushed to main

# what:
#   - transpiles ts -> js and builds browser bundles to ensure everything builds without error.
#   - runs type checker
#   - runs tests (currently in node environment only)
#   - runs linter. Will fail if there are any warnings
